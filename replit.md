# Internet Service Optimization Project

## Overview
This is a C++ command-line application that solves network optimization problems for an ISP company. The program implements various graph algorithms to help with network planning and optimization.

## Project Purpose
- Compute Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for optimal fiber wiring
- Solve Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for delivery routes
- Calculate Maximum Flow between network nodes
- Determine nearest exchange center for new service locations

## Technology Stack
- Language: C++
- Compiler: Clang (C++17 standard)
- Type: Command-line application

## Project Status
- Currently set up with basic template structure
- Ready for algorithm implementation

## Recent Changes
- **2025-11-11**: Initial project setup in Replit environment
  - Installed C++ compiler (clang)
  - Configured build and run workflow
  - Created project documentation

## Project Architecture
- `main.cpp`: Entry point with placeholder for four main algorithm components
- Input/output: Console-based interaction
- Build system: Direct compilation with clang++

## Development Notes
- This is a console application, no web server needed
- Algorithms to implement: MST, TSP, Max Flow, Nearest Point
- Uses standard C++ libraries
